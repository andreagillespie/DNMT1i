# DNMT1i
These are the scripts I wrote in conducting analysis for the DNMT1i manuscript. The experiments for which I'm including analysis in this repo are:

ATACseq/220215: 4 conditions NT & gRNF4 both +/- DNMT1i conducted in triplicate. Processing and initial analysis was performed by NGB. These scripts for additional downstream analysis I performed in preparation and revision of the manuscript.

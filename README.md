# DNMT1i
These are the scripts I wrote in conducting analysis for the DNMT1i manuscript. Unless otherwise noted the 4 conditions used in this project were gNT-DMSO, gNT-DNMT1i, gRNF4-DMSO, & gRNF4-DNMT1i. The experiments for which I'm including analysis in this repo are:

ATACseq_220215: 4 conditions NT & gRNF4 both +/- DNMT1i conducted in triplicate. Processing and initial analysis was performed by NGB. These scripts for additional downstream analysis I performed in preparation and revision of the manuscript.

ChIPseq_AGRF2105: Original DNMT1 chip in the 4 conditions listed above, n=1. Processing and initial analysis was conducted by EYNL. These scripts are from the additional analysis I performed.

ChIPseq_250217: This is another chip for DNMT1 as follows, WT & CXXC both +/- drug n=2 and WT-gNT, WT-gRNF4, KR-gNT, KR-gRNF4 all +/- drug n=1. For this experiment I did all processing and analysis end-to-end with the included scripts.

ChIPseq_250627: These are chips of GFP-tagged DNMT1 in WT, NTC, UHRF1-KO, ∆RFTS, and ∆RC +/- drug. I conducted end-to-end processing for this experiment so all is included here.

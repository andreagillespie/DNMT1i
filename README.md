# DNMT1i
These are the scripts I wrote in conducting analysis for the DNMT1i manuscript. Unless otherwise noted the 4 conditions used in this project were gNT-DMSO, gNT-DNMT1i, gRNF4-DMSO, & gRNF4-DNMT1i. The experiments for which I'm including analysis in this repo are:

ATACseq_220215: 4 conditions NT & gRNF4 both +/- DNMT1i conducted in triplicate. Processing and initial analysis was performed by NGB. These scripts for additional downstream analysis I performed in preparation and revision of the manuscript.

ChIPseq_AGRF2105: original DNMT1 chip in the 4 conditions listed above. Processing and initial analysis was conducted by EYL. These scripts are from the additional analysis I performed.
